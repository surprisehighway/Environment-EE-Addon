This is a fork from https://github.com/davist11/Environment-EE-Addon

We modified it to pull the NSM_ENV variable from Config Bootstrap.

Display which environment you are on **at all times** in the CP so you don't accidentally do something bad on the production environment. 

The value of NSM_ENV will be injected into the header of the CP and fixed to the screen as you scroll.

*Note: only shown to Super Admins.*
